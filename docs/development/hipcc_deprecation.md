# hipcc Deprecation Guide

`hipcc` is a compiler wrapper that historically injected HIP-specific flags
(include paths, device library paths, GPU target flags, etc.) before invoking
`clang++`. TheRock is deprecating `hipcc` in favor of calling `amdclang++`
directly, which is a symlink to the same underlying clang binary with the HIP
toolchain configured by CMake.

This document explains why the change is being made, what the equivalents are,
and how to migrate your project.

## Why deprecate hipcc?

- **Redundant indirection.** The `amd-hip` CMake toolchain already injects
  `--hip-path`, `--hip-device-lib-path`, and all other necessary flags via
  `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_INIT`. hipcc was doing the same thing via shell script logic,
  creating two overlapping mechanisms for the same job.
- **CMake-native HIP support.** CMake has had first-class HIP language support
  since CMake 3.21. Projects using `enable_language(HIP)` or
  `set_source_files_properties(... PROPERTIES LANGUAGE HIP)` work correctly with
  `CMAKE_HIP_COMPILER` pointing to `amdclang++` directly — no wrapper needed.
- **Transparency.** Direct `amdclang++` invocations produce cleaner build logs,
  better IDE integration (via `compile_commands.json`), and easier debugging of
  compiler flags.
- **hipconfig.** `hipconfig` is the companion introspection tool bundled with
  `hipcc`. Callers that used `hipconfig --version`, `--cxxflags`, or `--ldflags`
  should migrate to CMake-native equivalents (see below).

## What changed in TheRock

- The `amd-hip` compiler toolchain now explicitly sets `CMAKE_HIP_COMPILER` to
  `amdclang++` (our built clang) in the generated `_toolchain.cmake` file.
- `--rtlib=compiler-rt --unwindlib=libgcc` linker flags are now injected via
  `CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT` and `CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT`, replacing
  the equivalent flags hipcc provided.
- `hipcc` is no longer listed as a `COMPILER_TOOLCHAIN` or `RUNTIME_DEPS` entry
  for subprojects that use the `amd-hip` toolchain.
- The test script `test_libhipcxx_hipcc.py` has been renamed to
  `test_libhipcxx_amdclang.py` and updated to use `amdclang++` directly.

> **Note:** The `hipcc` binary is still built as part of TheRock for now as a
> compatibility shim. This will be removed in a future PR once all downstream
> consumers have migrated.

## Flag equivalency table

The following table maps hipcc's implicit behavior to the explicit flags or
CMake variables that replace it when using `amdclang++` directly.

| hipcc behavior | amdclang++ / CMake equivalent |
|---|---|
| Injects `-I<hip>/include` | `--hip-path=<path>` (set in `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_INIT`) |
| Injects `--hip-device-lib-path=<path>` | `--hip-device-lib-path=<path>` (set in `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_INIT`) |
| Sets HIP compiler in CMake | `CMAKE_HIP_COMPILER` set to `amdclang++` in toolchain |
| Adds `--rtlib=compiler-rt --unwindlib=libgcc` | Added to `CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT` and `CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT` |
| Auto-detects GPU targets via `rocm_agent_enumerator` | `AMDGPU_TARGETS` / `CMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES` set by TheRock super-project |
| Defines `-D__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__` | Added by `hip-config.cmake` target properties via `find_package(hip)` |

## Migrating a CMake project

### Compiler

Replace any explicit `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=hipcc` with `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=amdclang++`:

```cmake
# Before
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=hipcc ...

# After
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=amdclang++ ...
```

If your project uses CMake's native HIP language support, set
`CMAKE_HIP_COMPILER` instead of (or in addition to) `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`:

```cmake
cmake -DCMAKE_HIP_COMPILER=amdclang++ ...
```

When building inside TheRock, this is handled automatically by the `amd-hip`
toolchain — you do not need to set these manually.

### HIP_HIPCC_EXECUTABLE

Some projects (including older versions of libhipcxx) use the
`HIP_HIPCC_EXECUTABLE` CMake variable to locate hipcc. Replace this with the
direct path to `amdclang++`:

```cmake
# Before
-DHIP_HIPCC_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/rocm/bin/hipcc

# After
# Not needed — use CMAKE_HIP_COMPILER or CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER instead
```

### hipconfig introspection

Projects that called `hipconfig` to retrieve version or path information should
migrate to CMake-native equivalents:

| hipconfig invocation | CMake equivalent |
|---|---|
| `hipconfig --version` | `hip_VERSION` (set by `find_package(hip REQUIRED)`) |
| `hipconfig --hip-version` | `hip_VERSION` |
| `hipconfig --cxxflags` | Use `hip::host` and `hip::device` imported targets |
| `hipconfig --ldflags` | Use `hip::host` and `hip::device` imported targets |
| `hipconfig --hippath` | `HIP_PATH` environment variable or `hip_DIR` CMake variable |
| `hipconfig --rocmpath` | `ROCM_PATH` environment variable |
| `hipconfig --compiler` | `CMAKE_HIP_COMPILER` |

Example of migrating a version check in CMake:

```cmake
# Before — calls hipconfig at configure time
find_program(HIPCONFIG_EXEC hipconfig REQUIRED)
execute_process(
  COMMAND ${HIPCONFIG_EXEC} --version
  OUTPUT_VARIABLE HIP_VERSION
  OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE
)

# After — version already available from find_package
find_package(hip REQUIRED)
set(HIP_VERSION ${hip_VERSION})
```

## Migrating a Makefile or shell-based project

For projects that invoke `hipcc` directly in a Makefile or shell script,
replace it with `amdclang++` and add the required flags explicitly:

```bash
# Before
hipcc -o my_kernel my_kernel.cpp --offload-arch=gfx1100

# After
amdclang++ \
  --hip-path=${ROCM_PATH} \
  --hip-device-lib-path=${ROCM_PATH}/lib/llvm/amdgcn/bitcode \
  -x hip \
  --offload-arch=gfx1100 \
  -o my_kernel my_kernel.cpp
```

When using a TheRock build, the `--hip-path` and `--hip-device-lib-path` values
are available from the toolchain's `_toolchain.cmake` or from the `hip-config.cmake`
installed in `<dist>/lib/cmake/hip/`.

## Known pre-existing issues (not caused by this deprecation)

- **roctracer** uses the legacy `FindHIP.cmake` module, which calls `hipcc` and
  `hipconfig` directly via `run_hipcc.cmake`. This requires a separate migration
  to CMake-native HIP language support and is tracked separately.
- **rocThrust** has a pre-existing build failure in its bundled `googlebenchmark`
  due to `-Wc2y-extensions` with clang 23. This is unrelated to hipcc deprecation.
